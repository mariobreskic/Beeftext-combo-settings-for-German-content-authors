# Beeftext combo settings for content authors
The following combos are meant to help content authors with typing typographically.
Special thanks to https://tgm-online.de/blog/sonderzeichen and https://github.com/WhistlingZephyr/espanso-package-quotes.
These combos output the same glyphs InDesign does. Special care was taken to use the proper dashes and spaces to maintain workflow in InDesign without having to navigate the menus to find the glyphs.

## Installation
Download the *.json files of the combos you want and import them into Beeftext from the Combos menu.
## Usage
These combos will replace the following keywords with their snippet
### Quotation marks
| Keyword | Snippet | Description |  
|---|---|---|
| :"< | « | LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK |  
| :"> | » | RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK | 
| :'' | ‘ | LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK |
| :', | ’ | RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK |
| :'_, | ‚ | SINGLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK |
| :'` | ‛ | SINGLE HIGH-REVERSED-9 QUOTATION MARK<sup>[*](#grave_key_issue)</sup> |
| :"' | “ | LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK |
| :", | ” | RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK |

<a name="grave_key_issue">1</a>: If your keyboard layout uses the backtick/grave key as a [dead key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key) only, you will have to work around that for these Beeftext keywords. If, for instance you use the German keyboard layout, you could switch to the [E1 layout](https://www.europatastatur.de/). This package of combos is a beginner’s introduction to the E1.
